A tiny 1.5V regulator suited to fit inside a WonderSwan. It allows to power the console with a Lipo Battery.
This is basicaly an EasyEDA project, but I also share gerbert and BOM files.

A working iumplementation of a Lipo mod using this regulator can be found here: https://www.pimyretro.org/wonderswan-color-discreet-lipo-mod/ â€ŽEdit
