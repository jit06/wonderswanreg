# wonderswanreg
A tiny (1x1 cm), XC6210 based 1.5V LDO regulator that fits inside a WonderSwan. It allows to power the console with a Lipo Battery.
This is basicaly an EasyEDA project, but I also share gerbert and BOM files.

I = Input 1.5 – 6V
E = Enable pin : must be bridged with the input in order to get any output
G = Ground
O = Output 1.48V

A working implementation of a Lipo mod using this regulator can be found here: https://www.pimyretro.org/wonderswan-color-discreet-lipo-mod/ ‎Edit
